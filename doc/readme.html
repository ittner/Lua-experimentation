Welcome to Lua 5.2

<H2><A NAME="about">About Lua</A></H2>

Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language
developed by a
<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/authors.html">team</A>
at
<A HREF="http://www.puc-rio.br/">PUC-Rio</A>,
the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
Lua is
<A HREF="#license">free software</A>
used in many products and projects around the world.
<P>

Lua's
<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/">official web site</A>
provides complete information
about Lua,
including
an
<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/about.html">executive summary</A>
and
updated
<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/docs.html">documentation</A>,
especially the
<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/">reference manual</A>,
which may differ slightly from the
<A HREF="contents.html">local copy</A>
distributed in this package.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="install">Installing Lua</A></H2>

Lua is distributed in source form.
You need to build it before using it.
This should be straightforward
because
Lua is implemented in pure ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all known
platforms that have an ANSI C compiler.
Lua also compiles unmodified as C++.
<P>

The instructions below are for Unix-like platforms.
There are also
<A HREF="#other">instructions for other systems</A>.
See below for
<A HREF="#customization">customization options</A>.
<P>

<H3>Building Lua</H3>

In most Unix-like platforms, simply do "<KBD>make</KBD>" with a suitable target.
Here are the details.
<P>

<OL>
<LI>
Open a terminal window and move to
the top-level directory, which is named lua-5.2.
The Makefile there controls both the build process and the installation process.
<P>
<LI>
  Do "<KBD>make</KBD>" and see if your platform is listed.
  The platforms currently supported are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    aix ansi bsd freebsd generic linux macosx mingw posix solaris
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
  If your platform is listed, just do "<KBD>make xxx</KBD>", where xxx
  is your platform name.
<P>
  If your platform is not listed, try the closest one or posix, generic,
  ansi, in this order.
<P>
<LI>
The compilation takes only a few moments
and produces three files in the src directory:
lua (the interpreter),
luac (the compiler),
and liblua.a (the library).
<P>
<LI>
  If you want to check that Lua has been built correctly, do "<KBD>make test</KBD>"
  after building Lua. This will run the interpreter on a "hello world"
  Lua program from the test directory.
  You may want to try other example programs in that directory.
</OL>
<P>

<H3>Installing Lua</H3>
  Once you have built Lua, you may want to install it in an official
  place in your system. In this case, do "<KBD>make install</KBD>". The official
  place and the way to install files are defined in Makefile. You'll
  probably need the right permissions to install files.
<P>

  If you want to build and install Lua in one step, do "<KBD>make xxx install</KBD>",
  where xxx is your platform name.
<P>

  If you want to install Lua locally, then do "<KBD>make local</KBD>".
  This will create a directory <TT>install</TT> with subdirectories
  <TT>bin</TT>, <TT>include</TT>, <TT>lib</TT>, <TT>man</TT>,
  and install Lua there as follows:
<P>

<DL CLASS="display">
<DT>
    bin:
<DD>
    lua luac
<DT>
    include:
<DD>
    lua.h luaconf.h lualib.h lauxlib.h lua.hpp
<DT>
    lib:
<DD>
    liblua.a
<DT>
    man/man1:
<DD>
    lua.1 luac.1
</DL>

  These are the only directories you need for development.
<P>

  There are man pages for
  <A HREF="lua.html">lua</A> and
  <A HREF="luac.html">luac</A>, in both nroff and html, and a
  <A HREF="contents.html">reference manual</A> in html in doc, some sample code in test, and some
  useful stuff in etc. You don't need these directories for development.
<P>

  If you want to install Lua locally, but in some other directory, do
  "<KBD>make install INSTALL_TOP=xxx</KBD>", where xxx is your chosen directory.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="customization">Customization</A></H3>
  Three kinds of things can be customized by editing a file:
<UL>
    <LI> Where and how to install Lua &mdash; edit Makefile.
    <LI> How to build Lua &mdash; edit src/Makefile.
    <LI> Lua features &mdash; edit src/luaconf.h.
</UL>
<P>

  You don't actually need to edit the Makefiles because you may set the
  relevant variables in the command line when invoking make.
<P>

  On the other hand, if you need to customize some Lua features, you'll need
  to edit src/luaconf.h before building and installing Lua.
  The edited file will be the one installed, and
  it will be used by any Lua clients that you build, to ensure consistency.
  (Further customization is possible by editing the Lua sources.)
<P>

  We strongly recommend that you enable dynamic loading. This is done
  automatically for all platforms listed above that have this feature
  and also for Windows.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="other">Building Lua on other systems</A></H3>

  If you're not using the usual Unix tools, then the instructions for
  building Lua depend on the compiler you use. You'll need to create
  projects (or whatever your compiler uses) for building the library,
  the interpreter, and the compiler, as follows:
<P>
<DL CLASS="display">
<DT>
library:
<DD>
lapi.c lcode.c lctype.c ldebug.c ldo.c ldump.c lfunc.c lgc.c llex.c
lmem.c lobject.c lopcodes.c lparser.c lstate.c lstring.c ltable.c
ltm.c lundump.c lvm.c lzio.c
lauxlib.c lbaselib.c lbitlib.c ldblib.c liolib.c lmathlib.c loslib.c
ltablib.c lstrlib.c loadlib.c linit.c
<DT>
interpreter:
<DD>
  library, lua.c
<DT>
compiler:
<DD>
  library, luac.c print.c
</DL>

  If you use Visual Studio .NET, you can use <TT>etc/luavs.bat</TT> in its
  "Command Prompt".
<P>

  If all you want is to build the Lua interpreter, you may put all .c files
  in a single project, except for luac.c and print.c. Or just use <TT>etc/one.c</TT>.
<P>

  To use Lua as a library in your own programs you'll need to know how to
  create and use libraries with your compiler. Moreover, to dynamically load
  C libraries for Lua you'll need to know how to create dynamic libraries
  and you'll need to make sure that the Lua API functions are accessible to
  those dynamic libraries &mdash; but you do <EM>not</EM> want to link the Lua library
  into each dynamic library. For Unix, we recommend that the Lua library
  be linked statically into the host program and its symbols exported for
  dynamic linking; src/Makefile does this for the Lua interpreter.
  For Windows, we recommend that the Lua library be a DLL.
<P>

  As mentioned above, you may edit src/luaconf.h to customize
  some features before building Lua.
<P>
