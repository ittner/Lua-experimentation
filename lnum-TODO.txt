Ideas for LNUM patch:
---------------------

- The test suite should be better, more coverage and better intended for
  all the possible modes there are:
  
        (LNUM_DOUBLE)
        (LNUM_DOUBLE) + LNUM_INT32
        (LNUM_DOUBLE) + LNUM_INT64
        LNUM_FLOAT
        LNUM_FLOAT + LNUM_INT32
        LNUM_FLOAT + LNUM_INT64
        LNUM_LDOUBLE
        LNUM_LDOUBLE + LNUM_INT32
        LNUM_LDOUBLE + LNUM_INT32

        ... and the same with LNUM_COMPLEX


Known bugs:
-----------

    AKa 2-Oct-2007
    
    No known bugs exist, but the code has NOT BEEN WIDELY TESTED since major
    complex number rewrite in 1-3 Oct 2007!
