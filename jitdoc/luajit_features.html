LuaJIT tries to keep the spirit of Lua &mdash; it's <em>light-weight</em>,
<em>efficient</em> and <em>extensible</em>.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
All functions are by default compiled Just-In-Time (JIT) to
machine code:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions that are unused are not compiled at all.</li>
<li>Compilation can be enabled/disabled selectively for individual
functions and subfunctions or even whole modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation (at runtime) is supported, too:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A number of API functions and command line options allows
full user control over the compilation process.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The JIT compiler is extensible:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The optimizer is an extra module that attaches to the compiler
pipeline.</li>
<li>Various modules provide trace and debug information about
the compilation process.</li>
<li>All of these features can be activated with command line options.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
The compiled machine code is <em>very efficient</em>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a look at some
<a href="luajit_performance.html">Performance Measurements</a>.</li>
<li>Special CPU features (such as conditional moves)
are automatically used when detected.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The JIT compiler is <em>very fast</em>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Compilation times vary a great deal (depending on the nature of
the function to be compiled) but are generally in the
<em>microsecond</em> range.</li>
<li>Even compiling large functions (hundreds of lines) with the
maximum optimization level takes only a few milliseconds in the
worst case.</li>
</ul>
<p>
LuaJIT is <em>very small</em>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole JIT compiler engine adds only around <strong>25K</strong>
of code size to the Lua core (if compiled with <tt>-Os</tt>).</li>
<li>The optimizer is split into several optional modules that
can be loaded at runtime if requested.</li>
<li>LuaJIT adds around 4.500 lines of C and assembler code and
1.100 lines of Lua code to the Lua 5.1 core (17.000 lines of C).</li>
<li>Required build tools (DynASM) take another 2.500 lines of Lua code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Only x86 (i386+) CPUs are supported right now (but see below).</li>
<li>Only the default type for <tt>lua_Number</tt> is supported
(<tt>double</tt>).</li>
<li>The interrupt signal (Ctrl-C) is ignored unless you enable
instruction hooks (with <tt>-j debug</tt>). But this will seriously
slow down your application. I'm looking for better ways to handle
this. In the meantime you have to press Ctrl-C twice to interrupt
a currently running JIT compiled function (just like C functions).</li>
<li>LuaJIT ships with <tt>LUA_COMPAT_VARARG</tt> turned off.
I.e. the implicit <tt>arg</tt> parameter is not created anymore.
Please have a look at the comments in <tt>luaconf.h</tt> for
this configuration option. You can turn it on, if you really need it.
Or better yet, convert your code to the new Lua 5.1 vararg syntax.</li>
<li>There is no support for tailcall counting in JIT compiled code.
HOOKTAILRET is not called, too. There is not much I can do
to improve this situation without undue complications.
A suggestion to modify the behaviour of standard Lua has been
made on the mailing list (it would be beneficial there, too).</li>
<li>GDB, Valgrind or other debugging tools can't report symbols
or stack frames for JIT compiled code. Unfortunately this is
rather difficult to solve. Have a look at
<a href="luajit_debug.html">Debugging LuaJIT</a>, too</li>
</ul>

<h2>Caveats</h2>
<ul>
<li>LuaJIT allocates executable memory for the generated machine code
if your OS has support for it: either <tt>HeapCreate()</tt> for Windows or
<tt>mmap()</tt> on POSIX systems.<br />
The fallback is the standard Lua allocator (i.e. malloc()).
But this usually means the allocated memory is not marked executable.
Running compiled code will trap on CPUs/OS with the NX (No eXecute)
extension <em>if you can only use the fallback</em>.</li>
<li><a href="dynasm.html">DynASM</a> is needed to regenerate the
<tt>ljit_x86.h</tt> file. But only in case you want to <em>modify</em>
the <tt>*.dasc</tt>/<tt>*.dash</tt> files. A pre-processed <tt>*.h</tt>
file is supplied with LuaJIT.<br />
DynASM is written in Lua and needs a plain copy of Lua 5.1-alpha
(installed as 'lua'). Or you can run it with LuaJIT built from
the <tt>*.h</tt> file supplied with the distribution (modify
<tt>DASM=</tt> in <tt>src/Makefile</tt>). It's a good idea to install
a known good copy of LuaJIT under a different name for this.</li>
</ul>

<h2>TODOs</h2>
<ul>
<li>I plan to support other CPUs when the LuaJIT core infrastructure
has stabilized a bit more.
<ul>
<li>Support for other architectures will be added based on demand
and/or sponsorship.</li>
<li>The most likely candidates are x64 (aka x86_64, AMD64, EM64T),
PPC (32/64 bit) and ARM.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Support for alternate types for <tt>lua_Number</tt> (<tt>float</tt>
or a 32 bit <tt>int</tt>) could be added.
<ul>
<li>But is there any demand for this on x86 platforms?
Please <a href="contact.html">tell me</a>.</li>
<li>Note that <tt>floats</tt> are not faster than <tt>doubles</tt>
on modern x86 CPUs.</li>
<li>Integers would be quite a bit faster, but are maybe too restrictive.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Right now arithmetics, loops and table accesses have been
optimized most. String processing has not been optimized at all.</li>
<li>C function inlining hints are generated by the optimizer,
but are currently ignored by the backend. This would be beneficial
for many applications.</li>
<li>The abstract interpretation approach used in the optimizer
is very simplistic. I intend to employ an MFP algorithm to improve
the precision of the analysis.</li>
